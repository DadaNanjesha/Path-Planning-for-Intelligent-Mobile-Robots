## A* Algorithm
The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm used in many fields of computer science due to its performance and accuracy. It is widely used in applications such as robotics, video games, and geographic information systems (GIS).

### How it works
A* uses a best-first search and finds the least-cost path from a given start node to a given goal node. It uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal from the current node, which helps in making the algorithm more efficient.

### Key Features
- **Optimality**: A* is guaranteed to find the least-cost path if the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the cost).
- **Completeness**: A* is complete, meaning it will always find a solution if one exists.
- **Heuristic**: The heuristic function helps in guiding the search towards the goal more efficiently.
