## 📊 Project Overview
The project contains several advanced path planning techniques, including:
### 🔹 **A\* Algorithm**
A classic grid-based path planning method that computes the optimal path using an 8-connected graph and a Euclidean distance heuristic.

### 🔹 **Bidirectional A\***
An enhanced version of A\* that simultaneously searches from the start and goal, potentially reducing the search time.
