# Advanced Path Planning Algorithms for Intelligent Mobile Robots

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various advanced path-planning algorithms used in autonomous mobile robots. These algorithms are widely applied in robotics, AI, and autonomous navigation systems. The repository includes implementations of A*, D*, Hybrid DQN-A*, RRT*, and Theta* algorithms, providing efficient solutions for navigation in dynamic and static environments.

## Features
- **A\* Algorithm**: Implements the classical A\* search algorithm and its bidirectional variant for optimal path planning.
- **D\* Algorithm**: A dynamic path planning algorithm that adapts to changing environments.
- **Hybrid DQN-A\***: A hybrid approach combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) with A\* for intelligent decision-making.
- **RRT\* Algorithm**: Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT\*) for sampling-based path planning.
- **Theta\* Algorithm**: An optimized variant of A\* allowing any-angle path planning.

## Installation
To run the algorithms, install the necessary dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Each algorithm can be executed independently. Example usage:
```sh
python A_Star/a_star_algorithm.py
```

Modify the scripts as needed to test different environments or configurations.

## Project Overview

The project contains several advanced path planning techniques, including:

- **A\* Algorithm:**  
  A classic grid-based path planning method that computes the optimal path using an 8-connected graph and a Euclidean distance heuristic.

- **Bidirectional A\* Algorithm:**  
  An enhanced version of A\* that simultaneously searches from the start and goal, potentially reducing the search time.

- **D\* Algorithm:**  
  A dynamic path planning algorithm that efficiently updates the optimal path in response to changes in the environment.

- **Theta\* Algorithm:**  
  An any-angle variant of A\* that uses line-of-sight checks to "shortcut" unnecessary nodes, producing smoother and more direct paths with fewer turns. This implementation includes dynamic visualization with step-by-step plotting and draws a continuous red line for the final path.

- **Advanced AI/ML (DQN-Based) Path Planning:**  
  An implementation that leverages deep reinforcement learning (using a Deep Q-Network) on the same grid structure to learn an optimal navigation policy through trial and error.

## Visualization
Pathfinding results can be visualized using the generated `.gif` files in the `media` directory.
